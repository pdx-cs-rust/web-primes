# web-primes: simple functional web service
Bart Massey 2021

This simple web service uses the
[Tide](https://crates.io/crates/tide) web framework to
provide a server that supplies random prime numbers with a
specified length in bits.

To try it out, `cargo run --release` and then browse to
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
